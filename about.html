		<p class="abouts">Ralph and Sons was established in 1953 by Ralph and Najla Nesrallah. It initially started as a truck stop, and has undergone many changes over the years. With the addition of the gas station next door and the growing number of regular customers, the restaurant expanded into its new renovated look. The owners have remained the same over all these years, and their head cooks are their two sons, Rick and Nick. By remaining a family business, Ralph and Sons has been able to provide good quality breakfast and lunch through all 50 years of its existence.</p>
